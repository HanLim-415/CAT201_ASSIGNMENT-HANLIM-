--- HOW TO RUN THIS PROJECT ---

This project uses JavaFX and the Gson library.
Since these are external dependencies, they must be configured in your IDE.

RUNNING FROM SOURCE CODE (IntelliJ IDEA)
If you wish to run the source code directly:

Libraries:

Ensure the "lib" folder (included in this project) is added to the project dependencies.

It contains: gson-2.10.1.jar

JavaFX Configuration:

If running on Java 11+, you may need to add VM Options to the Run Configuration:
--module-path "\path\to\javafx-sdk\lib" --add-modules javafx.controls,javafx.fxml

NOTE: To avoid path issues, I have included the necessary JavaFX jars in the "lib1" folder as well.
Please add all JARs in the "lib" folder to the project's library path.

Thank you!
